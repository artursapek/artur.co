Blog system
<p>
I spent a few hours writing some scrappy go code to run a blog on this website.
I've also moved previously published shit into it.

<h3>What's been up?</h3>
<p>
Not a whole lot. Tried to buy a house in upstate NY but got shafted by the seller's agent. Started a rewrite
of <a href="https://mondrian.io">Mondrian</a> but that won't see the light of day for a while.
Working hard at <a href="https://kraken.com">Kraken</a>. Enjoying the East Village.
