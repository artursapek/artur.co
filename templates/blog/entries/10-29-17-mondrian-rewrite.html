Mondrian rewrite

<p>
I've deployed an in-progress rewrite of <a href="https://mondrian.io">Mondrian</a>. It's not up to snuff yet
so I'm not pushing or promoting it anywhere. But it's live now. I needed a release. Been keeping it to myself for too long.

It's actually already more useful than the last one: fewer bugs and more functionality.
