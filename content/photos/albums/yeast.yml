    Thanks to dad I've gotten into making bread. It's extremely fun, takes very little time, and tastes 100 times better than anything from a grocery store. And you get to eat it fresh out of the oven.
    I'm starting out with <a href="http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11376-no-knead-bread">no-knead bread</a> to get some practice but I hope to branch out to levain-based breads later.
