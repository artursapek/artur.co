    Observation: <a href='https://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:CVGW'>Calavo Growers</a> stock
    is up 37% in the last year. I buy exclusively Calavo, their stuff is better than California's.
    They also seem to be one of only two big suppliers to Whole Foods around here.
    CVGW looks like a good buy!
