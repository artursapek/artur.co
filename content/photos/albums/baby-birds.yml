    A baby bird fell off Daphne's roof, onto their charcoal grill. She and I rescued it from
    the literal pile of ashes it was laying in and now everyone on the block is working together
    to nurse it back to health!

    Mollie got the gig she wanted furnishing Sylvester Stallone's old house for some art dealer she knows,
    so she's motivated to finish some old furniture projects she started last summer.

    Ajax reached a new milestone: he has had coffee. He took a sip of Mollie's Americano
    while she wasn't looking. He was spitting and making really funny faces after. You can see he also spilled
    some on his shirt.
