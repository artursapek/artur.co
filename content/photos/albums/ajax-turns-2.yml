    Some Codecademy user in Romania was taking advantage of us. He was using the
    practice servers that come with our courses to DoS his opponents in Counter
    Strike games (seriously?!). We found his perl scripts and even tracked down
    his game server. We wanted to shoot him but we couldn't find him.
